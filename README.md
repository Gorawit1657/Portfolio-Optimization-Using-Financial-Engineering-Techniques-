# Portfolio Optimization Using Financial Engineering Techniques

This project explores the application of financial engineering techniques to optimize a portfolio of assets. Using statistical methods and portfolio theory, the project aims to minimize risk while maximizing returns for a given set of financial assets.

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to apply portfolio optimization techniques to create an optimal investment portfolio using historical data from the S&P 500 index. You will learn how to balance risk and return by constructing a portfolio that minimizes risk or maximizes the Sharpe Ratio, taking into account various constraints and bounds.
  
## Key Achievements

- Successfully implemented **Markowitz Efficient Frontier** for visualizing optimal portfolios with different risk levels.
- Developed a **risk-adjusted optimization model** using the Sharpe Ratio.
- Integrated **CAPM analysis** to evaluate individual asset contributions to the overall portfolio risk.
- Applied **data-driven strategies** to improve portfolio performance through diversification.
  
## Features

- **Efficient Frontier Plotting**: Visual representation of portfolios with varying risk-return profiles.
- **Sharpe Ratio Maximization**: Portfolio optimization that adjusts for risk.
- **CAPM Analysis**: Evaluation of systematic vs. unsystematic risk.
- **Scenario Testing**: Simulations for evaluating different economic conditions on portfolio performance.

# Results
The project demonstrates how modern portfolio theory can be applied to construct an efficient portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. By analyzing historical data and using statistical models, the optimal portfolio for a given set of assets can be identified.
