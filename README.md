# Portfolio Optimization Using Financial Engineering Techniques

This project explores the application of financial engineering techniques to optimize a portfolio of assets. Using statistical methods and portfolio theory, the project aims to minimize risk while maximizing returns for a given set of financial assets.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates portfolio optimization using key financial engineering concepts. The project is designed to help understand and implement techniques such as:

- **Portfolio Theory and Optimization**: Using Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to calculate the optimal asset allocation based on expected returns and covariance.
- **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**: To estimate the expected return of assets based on their risk relative to the market.
- **Risk and Risk-Adjusted Measures**: Calculation of risk metrics like volatility and Sharpe Ratio to adjust for risk when comparing returns.
- **Statistical Methods and Analysis**: Use of covariance matrices and statistical modeling to forecast asset performance.
  
## Key Achievements

- Successfully implemented **Markowitz Efficient Frontier** for visualizing optimal portfolios with different risk levels.
- Developed a **risk-adjusted optimization model** using the Sharpe Ratio.
- Integrated **CAPM analysis** to evaluate individual asset contributions to the overall portfolio risk.
- Applied **data-driven strategies** to improve portfolio performance through diversification.
  
## Features

- **Efficient Frontier Plotting**: Visual representation of portfolios with varying risk-return profiles.
- **Sharpe Ratio Maximization**: Portfolio optimization that adjusts for risk.
- **CAPM Analysis**: Evaluation of systematic vs. unsystematic risk.
- **Scenario Testing**: Simulations for evaluating different economic conditions on portfolio performance.

# Results
The project demonstrates how modern portfolio theory can be applied to construct an efficient portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. By analyzing historical data and using statistical models, the optimal portfolio for a given set of assets can be identified.
